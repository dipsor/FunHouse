## Technical Questions

### 1. How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time?
    - I spent roughly 9 hours on the task. I was working through one solution which did not work
      so I decided to rework it a bit.
    - If I had more time, I would try to refactor the code better, also I would add some tools to test code quality
      such as: phpinsights, phpstan, PHP_CodeSniffer, phpmd

### 2. Why did you choose PHP as your main programming language?
    - when I was younger I found quite fascinating to be able to create websites and as PHP was the most popular
      language for that, I sticked to it and satrted using it and studying it properly.

### 3. What is your favourite thing about your most familiar PHP framework (Laravel / Symfony etc)?
    - I am the most familiar with Laravel and my favourite thing about it is the expressive beautiful syntax,
      out of the box features and big community.

### 4. What is your least favourite thing about the above framework?
    - Sometimes quite difficult to find bugs and also the upgrades might take quite time. 
    - Eloqeunt is nice to use but for larger data it can easily run out of memory.
